# RPG MO - All in one Bot
So what is? RPG MO - All in one Bot

It is a bot for the game RPG MO that can train skills such as Woodcutting,fishing and Digging sand but i will/im currelty addings more skills all the time and the goal is to add all the skills in the game and make it do things like,auto hunt and kill mobs/AutoFight,Market Bot/sniping,soulve capatchas,being able to run the bot with any browser and not just the client version of the game,running more then 1 bot at the time/multiboxing bot and also making the bot run AFK/so you dont have to have the game open while it is botting.

**Setting up the bot**

So this is what you need to do to be able to run the bot.

First of You need Client version of the game not the browser version:
 [Link to Client](http://mo.ee/download.html)

also you need to Enable some Mods in the game and change some keybinding before you start the bot.
Mods that needs to be ON:

Enhanced Market,Keybinding Extensions,Pet Inventory,Chest Inventory and Miscellaneous Improvements

Keybindings:

`E` Deposit All+ in chest

`X` Unload pet inventory

`C` Load pet inventory

`Q` Toggle inventory

`Z` Withdraw 1 or ALL


Game Options ---> Video:

Smoother Layout = `Off`

Fullscreen = `Off`

`Ctrl` + `Escape` = Exits the bot

So after you have setup everything in the game then there are 2 ways of running the bot,ether you run the RPG MO - All in one Bot.exe or you run the source code with Autohtokey.
(i recommend running the .exe way if you havent used Autohtokey before) 

__Running the script:__
* 1) Download Autohotkey (http://ahkscript.org/download/ahk-install.exe).
* 2) Install Autohotkey 64 or 32 Bits.
* 3) Copy the Code.
* 4) Paste it in to notepad or any other text editor you use-
* * 5) Save it as  `RPG MO - All in One Bot.ahk`
* 6) Double click the `RPG MO - All in One Bot.ahk` file
* 7) Now its running, you should see a small icon with a Spade on it in the right corner of the Taskbar/Startbar.
* 8) Now when its running you should see a GUI/ a window on the screen.
* 9) Select what option you want to run/bot. 
* 
So now the bot is running :D
