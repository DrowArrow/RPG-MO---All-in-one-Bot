How to make your own Script/How the script works:

Fir = Selling type/material
5 = Exp per item/thing
Left 3,Down 10,Right 2 = The walking path to the Stash/chest.
405 231 = Opens the Stash/chest if it doesn't open by walking to it
Left 1,Up 10,Right 4 =  The walking path back to the place you were before.
Skill:|Woodcutting||Location/Coordinates:|Dorpat (23,27)||Requirements:|Woodcutters Axe.

line 8 is the info of the script so you will know how to use it/what you need to have/what level you need to be and also the location and coordinates you need to stand on when you start the bot Also the | = new lines so if it says like this:

tree|dopat

it means that the info will show like this in the messagebox:

tree
dorpat

and if there is 2  then it will show the info like this:

tree

dorpat
